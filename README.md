# [Android Greeting App](https://github.com/criptowaco/android-greeting-app)

A simple Android app built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**.  
The app displays greeting messages with a customizable name on a full cyan background, with an option to easily switch between Birthday and Christmas greetings.
